# EcoSphere — Project Setup Repository



*COMP2300 — Group Project*



This repository contains the initial setup for the EcoSphere application. It serves as the foundation for future development and includes early structural folders, assets, and placeholders required to begin implementing the system.

## Overview



EcoSphere is a mobile application concept designed to encourage sustainable household energy behaviour. The system combines scheduling tools, reminders, and a light gamified progression model where users complete real-world energy-saving tasks to earn in-game rewards.



This repository currently contains the basic structure required for the upcoming development phase.

## Planned Core Features



This repository will eventually support the implementation of the following foundational features:



* User login and account setup

* Reminder and scheduling system for household devices

* Daily task system with progress tracking

* Gamified resource and structure progression

* Dashboard displaying key user metrics

* Build mode for placing and managing in-game structures

* Solar system navigation representing user progress

* Settings for personalisation and notification control



These form the baseline scope for the first development milestone.

## Development Notes



Final technology choices are still to be confirmed. This repository currently acts as the starting point for organising shared code, assets, and development processes. As the project progresses, new directories, modules, and implementation files will be added to support the core features.
